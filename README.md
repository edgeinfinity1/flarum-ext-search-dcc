Search replaces the native Flarum search functionality which relies on MySQL badly performing
fulltext search with one that is completely relying on the proven elasticsearch engine.

## Features

- Sync discussions to elastic search using your queue, unobtrusively for the user.
- Reduces search loading times to well below 400ms (local tests with 50.000 discussion **260ms**)
- Uses Flarum's group permissions and tags system.
- Compatible with Friends of Flarum By≈çbu.

## Installation

Use composer:

```bash
composer require blomstra/search:*
```

Enable the extension inside the admin area and configure the settings.

### Set up

Enable the extension in your admin area. Now to seed your existing discussions use the following command:

```
php flarum blomstra:search:index
```

All mutations to discussions are automatically added and removed from the elasticsearch index.
